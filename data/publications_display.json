      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>                   <jats:p>Ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin\u2010like proteins (Ubls) orchestrate diverse cellular processes through reversible post\u2010translational modification of target proteins. Their conjugation is governed by a cascade of E1 activating, E2 conjugating, and E3 ligating enzymes, while deconjugation is mediated by deubiquitinases (DUBs) and Ubl\u2010specific proteases. Profiling the catalytic activity of these enzymes is essential for understanding the dynamics and specificity of Ub/Ubl signaling. Activity\u2010based probes (ABPs) have emerged as powerful tools to covalently label active enzymes through electrophilic warheads that target catalytic residues. Unlike conventional affinity\u2010based approaches, ABPs capture functional states of enzymes in complex biological systems. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of ABPs designed for the Ub/Ubl signal pathways, encompassing probes for Ub, SUMO, NEDD8, ISG15, FAT10, UFM1, URM1, Atg8\u2010family modifiers, and FUBI (MNSF\u03b2). We discuss key elements of probe design, including recognition domains, electrophilic warheads (e.g., vinyl sulfones, vinyl methyl esters, propargylamine, azapeptide esters), and detection tags. Particular emphasis is placed on emerging azapeptide ester\u2010based probes, which structurally mimic native enzyme\u2010substrate intermediates and offer high selectivity and reactivity. ABPs targeting E1, E2, and HECT/RBR E3 ligases are also highlighted, expanding their utility beyond classical DUB profiling. We further compare warhead chemistries, enzyme selectivity, and labeling strategies, and examine structural insights derived from probe\u2010enzyme complexes. Collectively, these tools have transformed our ability to interrogate Ub/Ubl\u2010regulating enzymes in vitro and in cells. The review concludes with perspectives on next\u2010generation probe development, including cell\u2010permeable designs, spatiotemporal control, and applications in systems biology and drug discovery.</jats:p>"

Electrolyte, as the medium for ion transport and sulfur conversion, plays a crucial role in overcoming these challenges. Here, we introduce a moderately solvating electrolyte (MSE) based on low\u2010density, low\u2010viscosity, and nonfluorinated ether co\u2010solvents that balances polysulfide suppression, Li metal stabilization, and redox kinetics. Through multiple solvent\u2013solvent and solvent\u2010ion interactions, the optimized MSE weakens Li                     <jats:sup>+</jats:sup>                     \u2010solvent pairing while strengthening cation\u2013anion interactions, thereby lowering the desolvation barrier and promoting the formation of a favorable solid\u2013electrolyte interphase (SEI).

This approach enables a stable cycling of high\u2010mass loading Li\u2013S cells (&gt; 3.5\u00a0mg cm                     <jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>                     ) at both room temperature and 45\u00a0\u00b0C (where shuttling and side reactions are severer), and demonstrates a pouch cell with lean electrolyte content (4.5\u00a0\u00b5L mg s                     <jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>                     ).

While DNA\u2010SWCNT hybrids have been widely studied, the structural arrangement of double\u2010stranded DNA (dsDNA) on SWCNTs and its impact on exciton\u2013fluorophore interactions remain insufficiently characterized. Here, we introduce carbon nanotube energy transfer with vertical nucleic acids (CNETvNA), in which fluorophores are positioned at defined distances from SWCNTs using guanine\u2010defect anchored capture sequences hybridized with complementary oligonucleotides.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy reveals efficient quenching of ATTO542 and ATTO643 dyes, with lifetime distributions reflecting heterogeneous duplex conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that dsDNA duplexes adopt a predominantly perpendicular orientation relative to the SWCNT axis, with increasing tilt and conformational variability at longer lengths.

    "summary": "Novel distance-dependent energy transfer mechanisms between organic fluorophores and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been detailed, employing defined spatial arrangements of nucleic acids for enhanced optical biosensing. The study reveals that as the length of double-stranded DNA increases, quenching efficiency of fluorophores changes in a manner consistent with theoretical models, demonstrating a critical distance dependence for effective energy transfer.

Commercial black mass, comprising cathode active materials and anodic graphite from spent LIBs, typically requires multiple energy\u2010intensive steps for the recovery and regeneration of its critical minerals. Here, we report that a single\u2010step microwave\u2010induced plasma pre\u2010treatment can lead to 85% selective Li recovery in water and \u224895% recovery of all transition metals in 1 M citric acid at room temperature.

The residue consists of anodic graphite, which is regenerated through plasma treatment that reduces defects and decreases the interlayer spacing. The recovered graphite shows excellent efficiency as an LIB anode, surpassing commercial graphite in its activity. While here microwave plasma pretreatment has been explored for LIB recycling, it is a technological innovation that can serve as a versatile pretreatment step for hydrometallurgical extraction of critical minerals.                   </jats:p>"

    "summary": "A groundbreaking microwave-induced plasma treatment significantly enhances the recovery efficiency of critical minerals from lithium-ion battery waste, achieving 85% selective lithium recovery and 95% recovery of transition metals in one step. This innovative approach not only simplifies the recovery process but also regenerates high-quality graphite for use as an anode in batteries, outperforming commercial alternatives. By integrating this technology into existing recycling frameworks, the study paves the way for more sustainable practices in battery material recovery, crucial for the evolving circular economy."

However, the lack of charge carrier concentration control in cubic BAs is a significant hindrance to its application in electronic devices. As\u2010grown micro crystals of BAs are reported to be unintentionally p\u2010type. Here, the evidence of inhomogeneous n\u2010type behavior in BAs crystals grown by an improved growth process reducing the impurities is present. Local n\u2010type doping is confirmed by four methods: current\u2010voltage measurement, scanning photocurrent microscopy, Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, and Hall effect. Their analysis enables the formulation of a model describing BAs band bending on contacts and bias. Analysis of scanning photocurrent microscopy reveals that the diffusion length of minority carriers in BAs is substantial, reaching 33\u00a0\u00b5m. Defect analysis performed by current transient spectroscopy, photo\u2010induced current transient spectroscopy and X\u2010ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that silicon\u2010substituted boron is a candidate for a donor in BAs. Presented results show the perspective for bipolar control of charge carrier type in BAs and consequently its application in better thermally managed microelectronics.</jats:p>"

This breakthrough enhances the potential for developing more efficient, thermally managed microelectronics, highlighting BAs' promising role in future semiconductor technology."

Therefore, this dynamic process holds significant potential as an effective cancer immunotherapy strategy. However, its adequate spatiotemporal control in cancer remains challenging. An Enzymatically switchable Pyroptosis\u2010Inducing polymer Conjugate (EPIC) is reported that selectively triggers chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) in the lysosome in the presence of Cathepsin B, abundant in cancer cells. When exposed to cancer cells in vitro, EPIC generates reactive oxygen species via self\u2010immolation\u2010mediated CRET, triggering lysosomal membrane disintegration, followed by activation of the signaling cascade that cleaves gasdermin\u2010D. Cleaved gasdermin\u2010D forms pyroptotic pores in the cancer cell membrane, promoting the efflux of damage\u2010associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines. When systemically administered into the tumor\u2010bearing mice, EPIC provokes a robust immune response by promoting dendritic cell maturation and reinvigorating cytotoxic NK cells. Combination of EPIC with anti\u2010PD\u20101 antibody enhanced infiltration of tumor\u2010specific cytotoxic T cells and promoted memory T cells, resulting in a durable remission of established tumors with complete tumor regression in more than half of the treated mice. Overall, EPIC has potential as a nanoplatform with multifaceted advantages for precise and effective cancer immunotherapy.</jats:p>"

    "summary": "Introducing the Enzymatically Switchable Pyroptosis-Inducing Polymer Conjugate (EPIC) marks a significant advancement in cancer immunotherapy by providing a method to precisely control pyroptosis in cancer cells. This novel approach not only triggers immune responses by activating dendritic cells and cytotoxic NK cells but also demonstrates enhanced efficacy when combined with anti-PD-1 antibody, leading to durable tumor regression in preclinical models. The multifunctional nature of EPIC positions it as a promising tool for improving the effectiveness of cancer treatments through targeted immune modulation."

Lubricants save vast amounts of energy and material resources by reducing friction and increasing the lifetime of devices. It is no surprise that the lubrication industry is one of the largest in the world. The climate crisis demands solutions independent of non\u2010renewable fossil energy, from which most of the liquid lubricants are extracted. Solid lubricants are the focus of the research community because they provide extremely low friction with a potentially much lower environmental impact. They are used when the operating conditions of machines do not allow the use of liquids, such as in a high temperature or vacuum environment, or when contamination mitigation is critical. The future of solid lubricants is bright. Can they truly be a direct substitute for liquid lubricants in certain applications, as many researchers claim, or will they be used only for applications where operating conditions are too harsh? In this perspective, the status and prospects of several classes of solid lubricants for greener and more effective lubrication are critically reviewed, with the hope that they can help us achieve the sustainability goals for the planet.</jats:p>"

However, the intrinsic in\u2010plane (IP) crystallographic anisotropy of \u03b1\u2010In                     <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>                     Se                     <jats:sub>3</jats:sub>                     introduces orientation dependence, leading to pronounced variations in memory performance depending on the IP alignment of the source/drain (S/D) contacts. This study presents the first demonstration of IP anisotropy\u2010dependent ferroelectricity in \u03b1\u2010In                     <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>                     Se                     <jats:sub>3</jats:sub>                     FeS\u2010FETs with S/D contacts aligned along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. The AC\u2010aligned S/D configuration achieves a ferroelectric resistance switching (FRS) ratio of 6.42, an on/off current ratio of 4.53 \u00d7 10                     <jats:sup>4</jats:sup>                     , and a normalized memory window (MW) of 59 %, whereas the ZZ\u2010aligned counterpart exhibits an FRS ratio of 1.05, an on/off ratio of 5.25, and negligible MW. The electron transports proceed through twisted pathways along the AC direction, but proceed along a straight trajectory in the ZZ direction to avoid high\u2010energy barrier regions due to the threefold rotational symmetric lattice. Thus, the excessive electron transmission and a reduced Schottky barrier height effectively screen the influence of ferroelectric bound charges in the ZZ\u2010aligned S/D contacts. These findings establish clear correlations between IP anisotropy and the ferroelectric functionality of \u03b1\u2010In                     <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>                     Se                     <jats:sub>3</jats:sub>                     , offering critical guidelines for the design of FeS\u2010FETs.                   </jats:p>"

    "summary": "The discovery of in-plane crystallographic anisotropy's effect on memory performance in \u03b1-In2Se3 ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) marks a significant advancement in non-volatile memory technology. The study reveals that devices with source/drain contacts aligned along the armchair direction achieve vastly superior electrical characteristics compared to those aligned zigzag, highlighting the critical role of crystallographic orientation in enhancing device functionality. This pioneering work provides essential insights for the future design and optimization of ferroelectric memory devices, paving the way for improved performance in next-generation electronics."

Existing pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy methods can recover valuable metals but suffer from high energy costs and wastewater generation. Here, a selective flash Joule heating chlorination and oxidation (FJH\u2010ClO) strategy is presented for the efficient separation of metals from spent batteries. In this process, cathode metals are first chlorinated for 60 s, after which the transition metal chlorides are oxidized to oxides, enabling lithium to be separated from transition metals due to their different aqueous solubility. This approach applies not only to the recovery of metals from lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode materials, but also to the anodic graphite, all from the black mass. The recovered graphite exhibits purity of \u2248100% with a yield of 85%, Co at 99% purity and 97% yield, and Li at 99% purity with a 92% yield. Gram\u2010scale experiments confirm the scalability of the method, maintaining high efficiency and selectivity. Life\u2010cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis reveal that the FJH\u2010ClO process substantially reduces energy consumption, operation time, and reagent consumption, while lowering operating costs by up to 92%, compared to conventional approaches.</jats:p>"

This innovative approach achieves high recovery rates and purities for critical metals like lithium and cobalt, significantly outperforming traditional recycling processes. With 92% lower operating costs and scalability demonstrated through gram-scale tests, the FJH\u2010ClO strategy represents a vital advancement in sustainable battery recycling technology."

Biohybrid microrobots, based on <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> algae, functionalized with the organophosphate-degrading enzyme phosphotriesterase (PTE), are shown to display unique light-switchable surface adhesion and gliding behaviors to offer an extremely efficient and fast surface decontamination. These biohybrid algae-PTE microrobots reversibly target hard-to-reach contaminated surfaces under blue light irradiation, while red light triggers their transition back to the bulk solution. In the surface-bound state, PTE-functionalized algae can glide collectively across the contaminated surface toward enhanced degradation efficiency. Upon completing the surface decontamination, the algae-PTE microrobots are easily released from the surface by switching to red irradiation. The applicability of the light-switchable microrobotic platform is demonstrated using a variety of contaminated surfaces, including fabrics, skin, and irregular solid surfaces, displaying surface-decontamination efficiencies higher than 90% within 5 min. Such highly efficient and rapid light-switchable surface targeting biocatalytic microrobotic platform holds considerable promise for diverse environmental surface remediation applications."

    "summary": "A novel light-triggered microrobotic platform enhances the decontamination of surfaces tainted with chemical warfare agents through accelerated biocatalytic degradation. Utilizing biohybrid microrobots derived from algae, which are functionalized with a specific enzyme, this technology achieves over 90% efficiency in surface decontamination within just five minutes. The ability to control the adhesion of these microrobots with light not only improves cleanup efficacy but also offers a versatile approach for addressing diverse environmental contamination challenges."

      "abstract": "Polyolefins are ubiquitous in consumer products but are notoriously difficult to recycle due to the inherent incompatibility of their common varieties. Current approaches to addressing this challenge often involve relatively complex syntheses or may compromise the properties of the parent materials. Here, a method is developed to compatibilize mixed polyolefins via acid-base interactions. With a single-step photocatalytic process, acid or base functionality can be readily installed onto polyolefins. The combination of acid- and base-modified polyolefins functions as a compatibilizers. Incorporating them into polyolefin blends results in excellent mechanical strength, with up to a 96-fold increase in ductility (from 22% to 2110%). Importantly, compatibilization can be readily achieved on postconsumer polyolefin mixtures. Furthermore, direct functionalization and compatibilization of polyolefin blends is achieved."

The single-step photocatalytic process facilitates the installation of acid or base functional groups, leading to significant improvements in mechanical strength and ductility. This approach not only supports the recycling of postconsumer polyolefin waste but also enhances the material performance dramatically, marking a significant advancement in polymer compatibilization techniques."

Conventional strategies, such as electrolyte engineering or separator modifications, often focus on single-component optimization, neglecting synergistic anode and cathode regulation. Herein, we developed a Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) filled glass fiber separator (ZSM-5@GF) to address these issues simultaneously. The ZSM-5 zeolite facilitates the Zn<sup>2+</sup> desolvation via binding H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, suppressing HER and side reactions. And it could also homogenize the ion concentration distribution for dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping. Concurrently, ZSM-5 zeolite could also immobilize dissolved vanadium species via electrostatic adsorption, mitigating cathode degradation and shuttle-induced capacity fading. Benefiting from the synergistic anode/cathode interface regulation, both electrodes dramatically extended their cycle life, and an Ah-level pouch-type Zn//V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> cell is also realized for continuous cycling. This bifunctional separator realizes synergistic stabilization of the Zn anode and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> cathode, offering a cost-effective and scalable strategy for high-performance AZVBs toward practical applications."

The development paves the way for scalable, high-performance zinc ion batteries vital for large-scale energy storage solutions."

Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we tracked the flow of heat from plasmonic tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals to surface-adsorbed perylenediimide (PDI) molecules upon excitation of the ITO near-infrared plasmon resonance. We rationalize that the derivative line shapes observed in the transient absorption bleach features are the result of thermal transfer from the ITO core to surface ligands based on temperature-dependent static absorption studies of the PDI molecules adsorbed on plasmonic ITO. Through a series of pump power-dependent measurements, we demonstrate that the PDI heating time is largely fluence-independent at the powers measured, while the overall recovery time increases. Elucidating thermal transfer rates at the nanocrystal and organic ligand interface is key for applications such as plasmon-mediated photocatalysis, where heating may obstruct hot carrier transfer processes."

Understanding these interfacial thermal dynamics is crucial for optimizing applications like plasmon-mediated photocatalysis, where heat can hinder desired charge processes."

      "abstract": "The development of cathode materials with high ionic conductivity and thermomechanical compatibility remains a major challenge for advancing solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), especially at intermediate operating temperatures. In this work, we present a comprehensive computational study of orthorhombic YBO<sub>3\u00b1\u03b4</sub> perovskites, where B = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni, using a combined approach of density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). We evaluate the influence of native defects, oxygen vacancies (V<sub>O</sub>), and interstitial oxygen (O<sub>i</sub>) on the structural, electronic, thermal, and ionic transport properties. Our results show that YCrO<sub>3</sub> and YTiO<sub>3</sub> exhibit thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) compatible with widely used electrolytes such as YSZ. Hybrid DFT calculations reveal that pristine compounds, except for YNiO<sub>3</sub>, behave as moderate-to-wide bandgap semiconductors, with native defects generally reducing the bandgap. MD simulations indicate that pristine (Pr) materials show negligible oxygen ion mobility, while the presence of defects substantially enhances ionic conductivity. O<sub>i</sub> defects are particularly effective, yielding lower activation energies and higher self-diffusion coefficients compared to V<sub>O</sub>. These findings demonstrate the critical role of defect engineering and highlight the potential of combined MD and DFT methodologies for the analysis and design of SOFC cathodes."

    "summary": "This research unveils the significant impact of native defects on the properties of YBO3\u00b1\u03b4 perovskites, a promising material for solid oxide fuel cells. Key findings reveal that intrinsic defects, particularly interstitial oxygen, enhance ionic conductivity by lowering activation energies, making these materials more effective candidates for cathode applications. The work emphasizes the potential of utilizing advanced computational methods to optimize the design and performance of electrochemical components in energy solutions."

      "abstract": "Biaryl motifs are central in pharmaceutical drug design, yet conventional synthesis via palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling poses increasing sustainability and cost concerns. The study presented herein explores a greener alternative to palladium using iron(II) complexes supported by tetra-aza macrocyclic ligands for direct arylation of pyrrole with phenylboronic acids. Under aerobic conditions, the optimized [Fe<sup>2+</sup><b>L1</b>(Cl)<sub>2</sub>] complex of ligand Me<sub>2</sub>Cyclam (<b>L1</b>; 1,8-dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) showed broad substrate compatibility across 23 derivatives, achieving yields up to 66%, and excellent tolerance for functional groups including halides, esters, and strong electron-deficient substituents. Systematic analysis of these results suggests that meta-substitution and mild electron-withdrawing effects favor reactivity, while bulky ortho-steric hindrance suppresses coupling. Mechanistic studies ruled out outer-sphere radical pathways and high-valent iron complexes but do suggest iron(III)-hydroperoxo species as the operative oxidant. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis was carried out on the boronic acid substrates to show that electron-withdrawing substituents enhance the boron electrophilicity and promote the proposed transmetalation step, positioning this step as a key target for mechanistic activation of the substrate. These findings highlight the potential of earth-abundant iron catalysts as sustainable, cost-effective platforms for C-C bond formation in complex molecular scaffolds."

      "abstract": "Rapid and accurate detection of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) is essential for guiding clinical treatment and preventing infections. Current dual-gene detection methods based on CRISPR-Cas systems often require additional transcription steps, which increase the complexity of the assay and extend the turnaround time. Here, we report a single-tube dual-gene detection platform that leverages the orthogonal <i>trans</i>-cleavage preferences of Cas9 and Cas12a. By exploiting the loss of RNA cleavage activity in Cas12a when guided by split crRNA, and the inability of Cas9 to cleave DNA hairpin probes, we established a single-tube assay capable of simultaneously detecting the MRSA resistance gene (<i>mecA</i>) and the <i>S. aureus</i>-specific nuclease gene (<i>nuc</i>). The platform achieved attogram-level sensitivity and single-cell detection with high specificity against non-MRSA strains. Validation in an <i>in vivo</i> tilapia infection model demonstrated complete concordance with qPCR, reaching 100% positive and negative percent agreements. This work presents a streamlined, accurate, and practical approach for dual-gene pathogen detection, expanding the potential of Cas protein orthogonality for multiplex diagnostics."
